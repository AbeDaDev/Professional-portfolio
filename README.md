üíº Developer Portfolio (v2)

This is my second portfolio project, built as an improvement over my original portfolio. It was developed based on a pre-existing template from the Scrimba Full-Stack Career Path.

While I had already created a personal portfolio, I chose to build this version because it had a more professional design and better structure. It reflects my growth as a developer and showcases my continued efforts to improve and present my work in a clean, modern way.

In the meantime, I‚Äôll continue improving my original portfolio to better showcase my skills‚Äîensuring that all the work, including the portfolio itself, is fully my own.
